# Observing EDR Telemetry
I logged into LimaCharlie and observed the Telemetry that I created so far and found the following

## Findings

- **I navigated to the "Processes" tab on LimaCharlie which allowed me to view all the processes that were running on the Windows VM. I noticed that the Sliver .exe (EVENTUAL_REWARD.exe) file that I launched from the Windows VM was running.**

- **I also navigated to the "Networks" tab on LimaCharlie which allowed me to view all the network connections on the Windows VM. While there, I noticed the malicious network connection that was established via the sliver file on the Windows VM.**

- **I then navigated to the "File Systems" tab on LimaCharlie where I was able to see the Windows VM's entire filesystem and I was also able to navigate through it. I found the malicious .exe file in the C:\Users\User\Downloads where I had previously stored it. While in the "File Systems" tab I was also able to inspect the hash of the malicous executable by scanning it with VirusTotal. However, since I just made the executable on sliver it was not able to find a match.**

- **After, I navigated to the "Timeline" tab on LimaCharlie which is a near real-time view of EDR telemetry plus event logs streaming from the Windows VM. While in the Timeline tab, I was able find the exact event and time where I had launched the malicious executable from the command line.**
