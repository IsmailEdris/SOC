# Building and Testing D&R Rules for lsass.exe

lsass.exe is an executable a critical Windows process responsible for enforcing security policies, handling logins, and password changes, and generating access tokens for users. LSASS manages authentication, including verifying user credentials during login and handling Active Directory queries in domain environments. This makes lsass.exe very appetizing for threat actors. In this step of the project, I created D&R (detection and response) rules to detect and respond whenever lsass.exe is accessed on the Windows VM. 

## Dumping lsass.exe from memory

- **From the Sliver server, I ran the command "procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass. dmp" to dump the lsass.exe process from memory on the Windows VM.**

## Writing and testing the D&R

**1. After, I viewed the telemetry in LimaCharlie. I also wrote a D&R rule that tells LimaCharlie to look only at "SENSETIV_PROCESS_ACCESS" events where the victim or target ends with lsass.exe and if it detects it, it just generates a detection report.**

**2. I then tested the rule before creating it to make sure it worked. The test detected that lsass.exe was launched and then generated a report for it.**

**3.  I then navigated to the "Detections" tab on LimaCharlie to observe the rule in real time.**
