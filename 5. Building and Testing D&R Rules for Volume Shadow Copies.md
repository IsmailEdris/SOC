# Writing and Testing D&R Rules for Volume Shadow Copies
Volume shadow copies are snapshots of files or even file systems. They provide a way for files and file systems to go back to a previous version, even if the file is in use. This makes volume shadow copies a very attractive target for attackers, especially if they plan on using ransomware. In this part of the project I created a D&R rule that detects and responds to attacks that target volume shadow copies.

## Creating and Testing D&R rules

**1. While having remote access to the Windows VM through the Sliver C2, I ran the command "vssadmin delete shadows /all" to generate a log on the Windows VM that said, "somebody tried to delete the volume shadow copies."**

**2. I examined the log on LimaCharlie and then wrote a D&R rule that detects the deletion of the volume shadow copies and then kills the process that tries to delete the files.**

**3. Additionally, I also tested the rule before creating it to make sure the rule works as intended. The test was successful. Once the rule detected the deletion of the volume shadow files it killed the process.**
