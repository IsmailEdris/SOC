# SOC Analyst Home Lab Project
Becoming a skilled SOC analyst requires more than just theoretical knowledge; hands-on experience is crucial. In this blog, I will take you through the process of setting up my SOC home lab. I used tools like LimaCharlie and YARA rules to detect and respond to malicious activities, such as Sliver C2 payloads, while refining Detection and Response (D&R) rules to minimize false positives. This process closely mirrors the workflows employed in real-world SOC operations. This project was inspired by Eric Capuano's [So you want to be an SOC Analyst?](https://blog.ecapuano.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-soc-analyst-part)
